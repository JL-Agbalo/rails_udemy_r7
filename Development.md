# Debugging in Ruby on Rails

Here are common debugging methods and tools to help you inspect your code, variables, and application state in Ruby on Rails:

## 1. `debug` Helper (in Views)

- This helper is used to output information about objects in your views.
- Example:
  ```erb
  <%= debug @products %>
  ```
- This will print a detailed inspection of the `@products` object to your view in a human-readable format.

## 2. `logger.debug` (in Controllers or Models)

- Use this to log debugging messages to the Rails log.
- Example:
  ```ruby
  logger.debug "This is a debug message: #{@products.inspect}"
  ```
- The message will appear in the Rails development log file (`log/development.log`), which is useful when you want to trace or debug data during execution.

## 3. `byebug` (Interactive Debugging)

- This gem allows you to set breakpoints and interactively inspect and manipulate variables at runtime.
- Example:
  ```ruby
  byebug
  ```
- When your code reaches the `byebug` line, execution will pause, and you can type commands to inspect variables and step through your code line by line.
- To install: `gem install byebug` (usually included by default in Rails).

## 4. `pry` (Advanced Interactive Debugging)

- **Pry** is a more powerful alternative to `byebug` that provides a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) environment.
- You can inspect and modify variables, step through code, and explore methods in real time.
- Example:
  ```ruby
  binding.pry
  ```
- To install: `gem install pry` and `gem install pry-rails` to integrate with Rails.
- When execution hits `binding.pry`, you'll be able to interact with the console.

## 5. `Rails.logger` (General Logging)

- If you want to log additional information in your application, you can use `Rails.logger`.
- Example:
  ```ruby
  Rails.logger.info "The product count is: #{@products.count}"
  ```
- This will log an informational message to the development log.

## 6. `puts` / `p` (Quick Console Output)

- You can use `puts` or `p` for quick debugging to print out variables or messages in the console.
- Example:
  ```ruby
  puts @products.inspect
  p @products
  ```
- `puts` is used to print to the terminal (standard output), and `p` is similar but it prints objects in a more inspectable format.

## 7. `rails console`

- The Rails console is a powerful tool for debugging interactively within the application.
- You can run `rails console` to open an interactive session where you can load your app and directly inspect and manipulate objects.
- Example:
  ```bash
  rails console
  # Now, you can test commands like:
  Product.first
  @products = Product.all
  ```

## 8. `ActiveRecord::Base.logger`

- Use this to debug SQL queries being executed by ActiveRecord.
- Example:
  ```ruby
  ActiveRecord::Base.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
  ```
- This will print the SQL queries to the console, which is useful for diagnosing database-related issues.

## 9. `raise` (Error Triggering)

- You can use `raise` to force an exception at a specific point in your code, causing it to stop and display the error message.
- Example:
  ```ruby
  raise "This is a custom error message!"
  ```

## 10. `Rails Backtrace Cleaner` (for Controlling Error Backtraces)

- Rails automatically cleans backtraces of certain lines of code to prevent unnecessary noise in error messages.
- You can configure it to show full backtraces in the development environment for more detailed error information.
- Example in `config/environments/development.rb`:
  ```ruby
  config.backtrace_cleaner.remove_silencers!
  ```

### Conclusion

These tools will help you debug and understand what's going wrong in your Rails application. Whether you need to inspect variables, see SQL queries, or step through your code, these methods offer a variety of ways to troubleshoot effectively.

# Rails Migration Modifications

## **Adding Columns**

Use `add_column` to add a new column to an existing table.

```ruby
add_column :users, :age, :integer, default: 18, null: false
```

### **Shortcut for Adding Columns**

```ruby
change_table :users do |t|
  t.string :nickname
  t.boolean :admin, default: false
end
```

---

## **Removing Columns**

Use `remove_column` to delete a column.

```ruby
remove_column :users, :age
```

### **Shortcut for Removing Columns**

```ruby
change_table :users do |t|
  t.remove :nickname, :admin
end
```

---

## **Renaming Columns**

```ruby
rename_column :users, :nickname, :username
```

---

## **Changing Column Type**

Use `change_column` to modify an existing column type.

```ruby
change_column :users, :age, :string
```

⚠️ **Note**: If data conversion is required, handle it separately before running the migration.

---

## **Adding Foreign Keys**

To create a foreign key relationship:

```ruby
add_reference :posts, :user, foreign_key: true
```

OR:

```ruby
add_column :posts, :user_id, :bigint
add_foreign_key :posts, :users
```

### **Adding an Index with a Foreign Key**

```ruby
add_reference :posts, :user, foreign_key: true, index: true
```

---

## **Removing Foreign Keys**

To remove a foreign key:

```ruby
remove_foreign_key :posts, :users
```

To remove the reference along with the foreign key:

```ruby
remove_reference :posts, :user, foreign_key: true
```

---

## **Renaming a Table**

```ruby
rename_table :old_table_name, :new_table_name
```

---

## **Dropping a Table**

```ruby
drop_table :users
```

⚠️ **Be careful** when dropping tables—this action is irreversible without backups!

---

## **Example: Complete Migration**

```ruby
class ModifyUsersTable < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]
  def change
    add_column :users, :nickname, :string
    rename_column :users, :full_name, :name
    remove_column :users, :age
    change_column :users, :email, :text
    add_reference :users, :company, foreign_key: true
  end
end
```

---

## **Notes**

- Always **run migrations** after making changes:
  ```sh
  rails db:migrate
  ```
- Use **rollback** if something goes wrong:
  ```sh
  rails db:rollback
  ```
- To check migration status:
  ```sh
  rails db:migrate:status
  ```

========

user_details = User.pluck(:name, :email)

- The `.pluck` method retrieves specific columns from the database, optimizing queries by not loading entire ActiveRecord objects.
